## Instructions

How to play Football!!! First thing to do before the start screen is add your player intials into the python shell. Once done, to begin the game press space, then the space bar will be used to shoot footballs at your teammates aka the purple dudes. Shooting the footballs at your teammates help them move up the screen to the endzone. Everytime your teammates make it in to the end zone you go to the next level. You get 5 lives so dont for get to watchout for the linebackers (aka bombs) coming your way. To move out of the way of the the linebackers use the left and right arrows. Also to prevent your charater from being hit by the linebackers shoot the footballs at them to kill them, but as you'll see some wont go away.It takes mulitiple throws to get rid of the big mobbyboys/linebackers and the little ones that move horizontal wont go away. Any time you hit a charater that is not purple you gain points but, certain linebackers will hit back by pushing your teammates father away from the endzone. If you get hit back to many times, meaning your teammates have been pushed off the screen the game will come to an end. The game will also end if your player gets hit to many times as well. However, if your teammates make it to the end zone the level with increase including the difficulty, your teamamtes will continue to get tired and need to takemore football hits to get them to the endzone. When the game ends whether if your player died or your teammates the endscreen will show you your score and  the level you got to before dying. As well as showing you a restart button controled by the letter R, a stats button controlled by the letter S and a quit game button controlled by the letter X.
